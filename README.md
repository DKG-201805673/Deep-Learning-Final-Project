## Project proposal form

Please provide the information requested in the following form. Try provide concise and informative answers. 

**1. What is your project title?** 

OCR for information extraction for semi-structured scanned documents

**2. What is the problem that you want to solve?** 

Our documents digitisation proposes a way that reduces storage costs, easing the process of administrative paperwork management, more environmentally friendly (i.e. reducing paper and ink consumption), saves time in retrieval, can be shared on a global scale, can be more efficiently tracked for compliance, keep important information into a more secured infrastructure. 

**3. What deep learning methodologies do you plan to use in your project?** 

The project consists of implementing an algorithm to localise scanned receipt texts. We aim to accurately recognize the text in a receipt image by getting coordinates and outputting the numbers and texts being extracted. The output will be then saved as a JSON file for each receipt image.
**4. What dataset will you use? Provide information about the dataset, and a url for the dataset if available. Briefly discuss suitability of the dataset for your problem.**
